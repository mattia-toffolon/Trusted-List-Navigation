        <h2 id="howtoruntrustedlistnavigationapplication">How to run Trusted List Navigation application</h2>

        <p>Here it is described in few steps how to run this application and how to properly use it.</p>

        <h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

        <ol>
        <li>Your environment must have a <strong>Java VM</strong> installed, if it haven't it you can download it from <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">here</a>.</li>

        <li>Your system must have an internet connection (:memo: <strong>Note:</strong> be aware that the response time of this application depends by the connection data-rate) </li>

        <li>You must have this repository on your local sistem. There are two ways to achieve that:


        <ul>
        <li>Clone it on your system moving in your preferred local folder and entering in your terminal <code>$ git clone https://github.com/mattia-toffolon/Trusted-List-Navigation.git</code> (you must have git installed).</li>

        <li>Or download it as zip from the green button on the top right of this page, unzip and open the unzipped folder (no additional software required).
        <br /></li></ul>
        </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="launchingtheapplication">Launching the application</h3>
        <p>Note that the .jar file is cross-platform compiled, so it would run in all common platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS). </p>
        <ol>
        <li>Firstly you have to move in the base directory (where is located the <code>.jar</code> file) and open a terminal on it.</li>

        <li>Then you have to type <code>$ java -jar Trusted-List-Navigation.jar</code> to launch the Java application. 
        <br /> :memo: <strong>Note:</strong> In case of not working internet connection or EU trusted data's server fault can be displayed an error before the application launch. In this case you should try again from point 2.</li>

        <li>Finally, if no error occurs the application should display home view. <br /><br>

        <h1 id="someconceptsabouttheimplementationoftlnapplication">Some concepts about the implementation of TLN application</h1>

        <p style="margin:30px">This application interacts with the <a href="https://esignature.ec.europa.eu/efda/swagger-ui.html">EU Trusted List API</a>
        to retrieve <a href="https://esignature.ec.europa.eu/efda/home/#/screen/home">EU Trust Services</a>
        data and provide useful search and display functions to <strong>analize EU trusted services data</strong>.<br />
        The API interaction is done over <strong>http protocol</strong> at application launching time. One call is made for
        <strong>retrieving country code and name</strong> (using <em>/tl-browser/api/v1/search/countries_list</em> service), 
        and the other is made for retrieving all the providers and services for every country (using
        <em>/tl-browser/api/v1/search/tsp_list</em> service).<br />
        The calls to API services retrieve data in <strong>json format</strong>, and this data is <strong>stored as JSONObject</strong>
        and parsed in Country, Provider, Service, Type objects only if it is needed. In this way only two http calls are done so
        their time overhead is reduced at a minimum point.  <br/>
        Moreover <strong>only needed countries are parsed</strong> in specific object so the time and space complexity is reduced
        at the lowest level. It is important to note that a county with its complete data is <strong>parsed</strong> 
        to specific objects <strong>only the first time</strong>, then is kept in case of future use.<br />
        Country complete data is parsed in a <em>Country object</em> that contains a <strong>collection of Providers objects</strong> 
        and every Provider contains its <strong>Service objects</strong> in a <strong>multimap</strong> using as <strong>key</strong>
        the <strong>ServiceType</strong>. In this way we can obtain a minimal time complexity to retrieve services by type.<br />
        Every Service object contains attributes for type, status and others minor informations.<br />
        When the user starts a new search a <strong>Query object</strong> is created. This Query object <strong>contains all the selected countries objects</strong> 
        (with all their data), and <strong>for each selection</strong> the user make, it <strong>compute and store a subset of informations</strong> 
        from the initial set of countries that mach the user selection. At the end of the selections only the services that meet the selections will
        remain, and they can be shown.<br /></p>
